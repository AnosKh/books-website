title: Trial Balance
intro: A Trial Balance is an accounting report which lists account balances for all your Accounts (“Ledger” and “Group”) for any given reporting period.
---

A company prepares a trial balance periodically, usually at the end of every
reporting period. The general purpose of producing a trial balance is to ensure
the entries in a company's bookkeeping system are mathematically correct. The
totals of Debit and Credit columns must be same for any given period, to ensure
the entries are correct.
