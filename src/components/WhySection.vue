            Why build another<br />
            accounting software?

          <p class="mt-5 text-gray-700">
            Offline Desktop software is a rare breed these days. Offline
            Accounting software even more so. With the myriad of cloud software
            available today, you must either pay for a subscription or host it
            on your server if the source is available for free.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700">
            Free accounting tools are not easily available and most tools
            require a server setup. Tools like GNUCash, which is open source and
            works offline, lacks in terms of UX. You need not require hours of
            training just to track your income and expenses. Frappe Books is an
            alternative to GNU Cash and Tally and is built with a modern UI.

            Why not cloud?

            Cloud apps make it easy to access our work from multiple devices
            from anywhere. But the primary issue with cloud apps is ownership of
            data. All your data must go through a server and you can only do
            things that server will let you do. The cloud provider has full
            control over your data. Pricing of cloud apps could change anytime,
            and you donâ€™t have the choice to use an older version as you have
            with offline desktop apps. With traditional desktop apps, you have
            much more control over your data and you can keep using a version
            that works for you.
